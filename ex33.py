#AI => Machine Learning (Data + Model) =>Hyper Parameters
#Experiments (Trying)

#(Epochs(Weights) and Learning Rate(0-1)
#      Epochs  => ex (1 epoch) that mean how many AI can read data; trying one time: how many time AI can Learn.
#      Learning Rate => how fast AI can learn model can go through data fast or not
#      Accuracy = 100 - error rate
